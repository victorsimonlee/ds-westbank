# ds-westbank
A Nintendo DS (unofficial) port of the classic ZX-Spectrum game "West Bank", using libGBA and C++..


This GAME is not finished, but it has at least the first level done. It was a personal experiment, as I was willing to develop some game
to my Nintendo DS. 

The project uses the **unofficial** library and old (discontinued) library "PALib".

I also recorded a small video of a gameplay, you can check it out at: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fogx8W_0Mv0


Cheers!
