Sprites & memory management:
----------------------------

1. static images for NPC have its Gfx loaded once, and then PA_CreateSpriteFromGfx() is being used to create sprites.

2. dying animations are created: one per door. Above technique is not possible, since they share same Gfx (all sprites sharing same Gfx animate togheter).

3. hatman are animations, so they are loaded like (2).

------------

AnimationManager may be switched to 'SpriteMemoryManager', where it will at every VBL cycle, check for sprites to be deleted.
